# EduRunner

A 3D educational runner game where learning meets arcade gameplay. Run through portals, answer questions, and test your knowledge on any topic.

Built for Steel City Hacks 2026.

## What is it?

Think Subway Surfers meets a quiz game. Your character auto-runs down a neon track while questions appear overhead. Three portals spawn ahead — each with a different answer. Move left or right to pass through the correct one.

The questions are generated by AI, so you can play on literally any topic: programming, history, cooking, sports, whatever you want.

## Tech Stack

- **Babylon.js** — 3D rendering and game engine
- **TypeScript + Vite** — Frontend tooling
- **Cloudflare Workers** — API proxy for OpenAI
- **OpenAI GPT-5-mini** — Question generation

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

For the AI-generated questions to work, you'll need to set up the Cloudflare Worker:

```bash
cd worker
npm install
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY  # Add your OpenAI key
wrangler dev                         # Run worker locally
```

Without the worker, the game falls back to a small set of offline questions.
